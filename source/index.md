## Well guess what?  They're tired of you too.

**This has to stop.**  

We have become a nation divided, and we are tearing ourselves apart. We assume the worst about the other side, making accusations of racism, elitism, ignorance, or privilege. There's a way to fix this, and it's going to take all of us.

### We stand at a momentous time in history

No one can deny that this moment is unprecedented in American history. Many people are afraid, many people see hope. The election of Donald Trump has driven the wedge deeper
